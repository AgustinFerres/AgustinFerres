## I am an enthusiast of the world of programming, since seven years old when my father showed me what a computer was. I was rapidly intrigued by how everything worked and how it'd understand what I wanted to do. Today I find myself discovering the world of programming, and little by little getting the answers I sought in my childhood. I am always eager to learn, and I think I am in constant development, technically and mentally.
